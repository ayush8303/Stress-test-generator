### Test Case Generator

This repository provides tool to generate failed test cases for competitive programming and DSA problems.

---

#### Guidelines

- The idea is to generate random test cases and test both the author's solution and your solution. Failed test cases should be printed in the `wrong_ans.txt` file.

- Generate small random values to easily identify failed test cases.

- Ensure overflow checks, as `int` is used as `int64_t` (similar to `long long int`).

- Use the repository example for graphs and trees - [undirectedTree.cpp](https://github.com/ayush8303/testCaseGenerator/blob/main/undirectedTree.cpp).
