### Test Case Generator

This repository provides tool to generate failed test cases for competitive programming and DSA problems.

---

#### Guidelines

- Generate small random values to easily identify failed test cases.

- Ensure overflow checks, as `int` is used as `int64_t` (similar to `long long int`).

- Use the repository example for graphs and trees - [undirectedTree.cpp](https://github.com/ayush8303/testCaseGenerator/blob/main/undirectedTree.cpp).
